This module creates a new customer / supplier aging report as of a given date.

The default Aged Partner balance report is related to a specific date and a
static PDF that is based on the difference between credits and debits, not
based on documents such as Invoices/Bills and Payments.

This module provides an interactive view with details of the invoice.

This module does not consider unapplied credits.
