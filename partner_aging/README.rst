This module creates new customer / supplier aging as of a given date.

The default Aged Partner balance report is related to specific date and a static PDF that is based on the difference between credits and debits, not based on documents such as Invoices and Payments. This module provides an interactive view with details of the invoice. This module does not consider unapplied credits.
