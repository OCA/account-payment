Configuration
=============

Go to 'Settings / Users / Companies' and assign the desired check format.

check formats such as DLT103.

Usage
=====

* Go to 'Invoicing / Vendors / Payments'. Select one of the payments with
  type 'Check' and print the check.
* For automatic check printing when validating payment, mark the field in
  the journal associated.

======================

* When print check automatically in the payment validation process, the wizard
  remains opened.
