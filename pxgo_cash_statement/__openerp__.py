Module for easier cash management.

Adds an "Entries by Cash Statement" view of the bank statements that shows only
the fields required for cash management.
It works with "Cash Statement Line Types" that allow to predefine cash lines
(pre-set the account, type [withdrawal/deposit], and description of the cash
statement line), so the user doesn't have to cope with those details
(even more, if the user introduces an invalid quantity, for example a positive
amount for a withdrawal, OpenERP will automatically correct the entry).
