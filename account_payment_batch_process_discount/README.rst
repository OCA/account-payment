OSI Batch Invoice Payments Processing
=====================================

This module is for Customers Invoices and Supplier Invoices/Vendor Bills.

Payments to multiple vendors can be processed. 
Payments from multiple customers can be processed.

Partial payments can be processed leaving invoice/bill open or writing off unpaid portion to a write-off account.
If the invoice has Payment Terms then when you do a Batch Payment the total amount of individual invoice will be
calculated based on the Payment term used on Invoice.
