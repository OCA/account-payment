In some countries, tax administration allows to apply taxes only on the cash discount deducted amount. So, taxes are not applied on the cash discount amount.

For example, if you have an invoice of 100 VAT excluded and 2% cash discount, VAT will be applied only on 98.

This module helps company to create invoices when their suppliers work like this. For each different tax in the invoice, two lines are added to the invoice:

* Cash discount amount for this vat without tax (+)
* Cash discount amount for this vat with tax (-)

Thanks to this module, the amount VAT excluded is not changed but taxes amount are correctly computed.
