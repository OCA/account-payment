    The objective of this hook is to speed up the installation
    of the module on an existing Odoo instance.

    Without this script, if a database has a few hundred thousand
    journal entries, which is not unlikely, the update will take
    at least a few hours.

    The pre init script only writes 0 in the field maturity_residual
    so that it is not computed by the install.

    The post init script sets the value of maturity_residual.
