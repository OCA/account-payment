* Create customer invoice and validate it.
* Apply register payment and set payment date which come eariler to discount
  days. For example: customer invoice amount is $1,000 and special discount(5%)
  available if payment done within 10 days. If customer will pay within 10 days,
  then register payment amount will be $950. System will make it as paid
  invoice. Because $50 is 5% discount of $1000 (customer invoice total amount.)
  If customer will pay $900 then invoice will be stay in open state. Because
  $100 is greater than of $50.
