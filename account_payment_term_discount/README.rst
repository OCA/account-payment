  days. For example: customer invoice amount is $1,000 and special discount(5%)
  available if payment done within 10 days. If customer will pay within 10 days,
  then register payment amount will be $950. System will make it as paid
  invoice. Because $50 is 5% discount of $1000 (customer invoice total amount.)
