Extends Account Cash Discount Base and Payment Order modules to let you
add invoices on payment order considering the cash discount on it.
When an invoice with cash discount is added to a payment order,
the amount proposed on payment line will be the residual amount discount deducted,
provided that the due date has not expired.

This module also offers to search by discount due date to add invoices on
payment order and add discount amount on payment line.
