        This module adds a wizard to renumber account moves by date.

        The wizard, that will be added to the "End of Year Treatments",
        let's you select one or more journals and fiscal periods,
        set a starting number; and then renumber all the posted moves
        from those journals and periods sorted by date.

        It will recreate the sequence number of each account move using their journal sequence so:
            - Sequences per journal are supported.
            - Sequences with prefixes and sufixes based on the move date are also supported.
