===========================
Account Payment Credit Card
===========================

This module supports the entry of credit card transactions as Supplier
Invoices, with payments moving the AP from the vendor to the credit card
company. A single Supplier Payment can then be made when a credit card
statement needs to be paid. New options on the Journal allow for this. The
workflows for recording and paying vendor purchases remain the same, so that
credit card purchases can be recorded just be using a different Journal.
Multiple Credit Card companies are supported.

Usage
=====

Refer to the `documentation <./src/account_payment_cc_README.pdf>`_.
