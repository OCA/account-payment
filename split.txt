florent_	Hi there, I just installed the "partner_firstname" module and would like to have two fields in website_sale's "/shop/checkout" named form on URL "/shop/address"
how can I override the "name" field with two fields "firstname" and "lastname" to be stored in the partner to be created ?

leio	florent_: does it actually output name field there, or just the object name (thus display_name)?

florent_	leio: it seems to display checkout.name
but I am not sure I understand your question

leio	florent_: but partner_firstname already does a computer "name" field that adds them together

florent_	leio: yes
but this is a form, it is empty when displayed here

leio	florent_: I was aiming at the fact that often the name field isn't used directly, but the object is printed, which ends up using display_name and name_get stuff.

florent_	leio: here the field content is splitted then saved into two partner fields (first- and last- names)
I probably have to modify the form and controller, right ?

leio	oh, ok, I understood your question a bit wrong
just inherit the template and change the form

florent_	leio: no controller to modify then ?

leio	and change the controller accepting the form if needed (maybe by using the field names for the input fields it will work without it if it parses out from the data dictionary)

florent_	leio: OK I will try that, thanks very much

leio	florent_: looking at it, I suspect you need to change things like _get_mandatory_billing_fields and _get_mandatory_shipping_fields and such as well then?

florent_	leio: I am looking at this more in depth so

leio	florent_: and validate function needs to have the all_form_values changed too from name to first_name and last_name, I'm ugessing

florent_	leio: OK thanks for your help and sorry for the newbie question

leio	looks like that comes from the template field_required hidden form input
whose attribute you can modify then
(t-att-value attribute
good luck :)

florent_	that will be needed ;-) !
thanks

leio	as a generic note, first and lastname fields is a western world thing; in some other places it can be bad to require such things
in some places middle name is very important, or there's no multiple names, whatnot; the world is a diverse place

florent_	indeed ; its required by french payment system here...

leio ok, yeah, if it's for a given country, the chance of issues with
that is not really big; unless it's just one payment support out of
many countries

anyhow, looks like it's good for you; just consider first vs last name
presented as something else maybe (given name and surname or
something); but I bet that's really in french too as well, where this
is more clear already
