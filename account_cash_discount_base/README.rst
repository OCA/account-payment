This module was written to allow you to define cash discount (aka early payment discount)
on customer or supplier invoices.

On customer invoices, you can add a discount delay and
a discount percentage. At invoice validation, the discount due date is generated
from the delay. The amount with discount deducted is computed at the same time
as taxes. This module also adds cash discount informations on customer invoice
report.

On supplier invoices, you can set the discount percentage. For the discount due
date, you can fill it directly or set a delay. In this case, discount due date
is still computed at invoice's validation.

You can decide to calculate the discount amount based on the total price taxes
included or not.
