This module lets you notify partners about sent payment or debit orders.

You can do that by e-mail and/or by SMS. It is automated by default.

**Table of contents**

.. contents::
   :local:

Configuration
=============

To configure automatic notifications, you need to:

#. Go to *Settings*.
#. Go to *Invoicing*.
#. Choose if you want to *Require payment notifications*.
#. Select the desired *Payment notification method*.
#. Select the desired *Payment notifications automatism*.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

#. Go to *Invoicing* or *Accounting* app.
#. Go to *Customers > Payments* or *Vendors > Payments*.
#. Select one or more payments.
#. Click on *Action*.
#. Select *Notify partners*.

Odoo will use your preferred notification method, as defined in
configuration (see that section), to notify all the chosen partners.

Both email and SMS notifications are put in outgoing queues. They will be
cleared automatically when their corresponding cron jobs are executed.

If you do that same operation from a payment form view, you will have the option
to choose between sending an email or an SMS. You will be able to edit the
template before sending it.

💡 Tip: You have new filters in the payments list. Use them to select those
that have (or not) email or mobile phone.

⚠️ `Sending SMS is a paid service
<https://www.odoo.com/documentation/15.0/applications/marketing/sms_marketing/pricing/pricing_and_faq.html>`__.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* Multiple SMS notifications to the same partner cannot be sent in batch.
  Always group payments before notifying. Odoo considers these SMS as duplicated
  and avoids sending more than one per batch. This behavior is hardcoded.
