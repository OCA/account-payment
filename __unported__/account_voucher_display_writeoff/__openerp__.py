Display writeoff options on sale or purchase vouchers. Without setting these
options explicitely, if a payment difference is encountered on vouchers of these
types, it is booked on the account payable or account receivable which can pose
problems for automatic reconciliation.

This addon also enables setting the voucher type as a selection criterium for
default values, so that you can set different default values for writeoff
settings for different voucher types.

At Therp, we use this functionality to write off small rounding differences
when applying an inclusive tax on purchase vouchers. This is currently
depending on lp:827649 for which we are proposing a fix.
