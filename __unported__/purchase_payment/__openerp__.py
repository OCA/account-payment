Adds payment type, terms, and bank account to the purchase orders.

Allows to set different default payment terms for purchases (the partners
will have payment terms and supplier payment terms).

The payment terms, payment type and bank account default values for the
purchase will be taken from the partner.

Invoices created from purchase orders, or from pickings related to purchase
orders, will inherit this payment info from the payment order.
