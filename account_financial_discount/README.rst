This module adds functionality to handle financial discounts for early payments,
and to generate proper write-offs during register payments.

**Table of contents**

Configuration
=============

Go to Accounting > Configuration > Payment Terms, to define a payment term
involving a financial discount:

* Set a number of days while discount is available after posting
* Set a discount percentage

Usage
=====

When a payment term with discount is selected on an invoice (i.e Customers
invoices or Vendor bills), the available discount will be stored on the first
payment term line once the invoice is posted.

The financial discount will then be applied using register payment wizard
if the payment is done before the discount date, or if the "Force financial discount"
is used on the invoice.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* Storage of available discount is only done if the invoice doesn't include
  more than one account.tax.
* Tax write-off is not only done automatically on register payment.
* On payment term having multiple term lines, financial discount will be applied
  even if the statement amount covers only first payment term line
* Financial discount cannot be applied if the payment is done in another
  currency than the invoice.
