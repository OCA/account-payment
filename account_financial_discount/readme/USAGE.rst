When a payment term with discount is selected on an invoice (i.e Customers
invoices or Vendor bills), the available discount will be stored on the first
payment term line once the invoice is posted.

The financial discount will then be applied using register payment wizard
if the payment is done before the discount date, or if the "Force financial discount"
is used on the invoice.
