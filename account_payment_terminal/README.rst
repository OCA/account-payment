This addon allows to pay invoices using a payment terminal. It communicates with the payment terminal proxy using the same protocol as OCA `pos_payment_terminal`.

Configuration
=============

To configure a bank journal as allowed to use payment terminals:

#. Go to the menu Invoicing > Configuration > Journals.
#. Select or create a new bank journal.
#. Set the field 'Use a Payment Terminal' to your terminal type.

Now you should create the payment terminals:

#. Go to the menu Invoicing > Configuration > Payment terminals.
#. Create a new terminal by setting:
    #. The hostname or ip address of the hardware proxy.
    #. The identifier of the terminal as known by the hardware proxy (Leave empty if the proxy has only one terminal connected).

Usage
=====

#. Go to Invoicing > Customers > Invoices and select an open invoice.
#. Register a payment.
#. Select the bank journal configured to use payment terminals.
#. Select a terminal.
#. Confirm.

You can test the flow using the mock terminal of `pywebdriver project <https://github.com/akretion/pywebdriver>`_ (an alternative to the POSbox/IoTbox).
