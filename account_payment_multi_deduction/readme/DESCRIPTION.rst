This module extend invoice(s)'s register payment feature,
from "Mark invoice as fully paid" with a single writeoff amount,
to "Mark invoice as fully paid (multi deduct)" which allow multiple deduction amounts.

**Note:** We use the word "Deduction", as the diff amount can be anything not only to writeoff.
